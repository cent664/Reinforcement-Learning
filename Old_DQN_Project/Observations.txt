After batch is better
Decay rate and gamma don't really matter much
1 year 10 episodes might be prone to overfitting, train less epochs? TEST AFTER STABLE RESULTS
5 year, 10 ep seems optimal
Filter size, window size
Training showed consistent improvement when using just stock images. Stock + Trend is inconsistent.
Volatile trends candlesticks (Stockmarket crash) - Inconsistent results, not sure if its learning
Stale trends candlesticks (Bitcoin) - Seems to do better but still testing, also testing simple representation


TO DO:

Automate everything

Better keywords (7, 8)
Ensemble learning
different filter sizes?
maybe try different trends time frames? (not 10am - 4pm)
